# spotify_tool

Web app for interacting with your spotify.

This is a project that I had the idea for years ago, I made a CLI application for spotify but now I want to rebuild it as a web app.

My basic Idea is to have a web app that allows you to login with your spotify account and then do various things with your account such as view your playlists and filter songs from that playlist based on different audio features included in the spotify API such as danceability, energy, valence, etc.
